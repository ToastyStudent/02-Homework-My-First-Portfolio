# 02-Homework-My-First-Portfolio

## Description
This project was built in accordance with instructions provided via Northwestern University's Full-stack Development Coding Bootcamp. with me modifying starter code provided them.

Specificlaly, I changed html elements in the index.html file to be more semantic than they were previously and commented that I did so accordingly.

# Installation and Usage
No installation is required. One only needs to visit the deployed github pages page for this project and inspect the elements to see the changes I made. Alternatively, you can download the github repository and view the style.css and index.html files to see my comments on what code I changed.

Both methods will allow you to effectively "use" my code to the degree possible.
