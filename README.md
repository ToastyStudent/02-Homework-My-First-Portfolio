# 01-Homework-Horeison-HTML-Element-Challenge

## Description
This project was built in accordance with instructions provided via Northwestern University's Full-stack Development Coding Bootcamp, with me writing code, using HTML and CSS, to create an online portfolio.

Specifically, I utilized semantic HTML elements in addition to CSS styling, particularly Flexbox, to have a responsive website with elements that adjust their size as the screen changes.

# Installation and Usage
No installation is required. One only needs to visit the deployed github pages page for this project in order to interact/use it properly. Said interaction/usage would involve viewing a short about me section I wrote, having access to links which could be used to contact me, and potentially visiting links to previous projects I worked on.

Alternatively, you can download the github repository and view the code to see how I constructed the project.

Both methods will allow you to effectively "use" my code to the degree possible.

More specfically, the entire reset.css file is the same reset.css file which is provided throughout Northwestern University's Full-stack Development Coding Bootcamp's course throughout various exercises, which I have used to reset the browser parameters.

Additionally, lines 7-24 in the style.css file are semi-modified versions of lines 28-45 from the previous Homework Assignment's style.css sheet which was provided by Northwestern University's Full-stack Development Coding Bootcamp.
